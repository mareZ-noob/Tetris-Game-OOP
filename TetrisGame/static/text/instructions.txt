- In the Tetris Game, you're faced with a dynamic grid filled with various tetromino shapes
 (I, J, L, O, S, T, Z).

- Manipulate and place these falling blocks strategically to create solid horizontal lines.

- Completing a line makes it vanish, earning you points and creating space for more blocks.
  Keep it up to clear as many lines as possible.

- Watch out, though-letting the blocks pile up to the top means game over. Can you master the art 
  of arranging and fitting the tetrominos to achieve the highest score? The game ends when you 
  either conquer the ever-growing block cascade or reach the stacking limit. Good luck!
