    In our "Object Oriented Programming" class, completing this project was a significant achievement. 
    Thanks to the guidance of Mr. Bui Tien Len, our lecturer, and the assistance of teaching
    assistants Mr. Truong Tan Khoa and Mr. Le Thanh Phong, we successfully navigated the process.
    Gratitude also goes to classmates and everyone involved in our project—thank you all!

                                    We sincerely thank you all!
