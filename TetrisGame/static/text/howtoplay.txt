- In the Tetris Game, you're faced with a dynamic grid filled with 
various tetromino shapes(I, J, L, O, S, T, Z).

- Your goal? Manipulate and place these falling blocks strategically 
to create solid horizontal lines.

- Completing a line makes it vanish, earning you points and creating 
space for more blocks. Keep it up to clear as many lines as possible.

- Watch out, though—letting the blocks pile up to the top means game 
over. Can you master the art of arranging and fitting the tetrominos 
to achieve the highest score? The game ends when you either conquer 
the ever-growing block cascade or reach the stacking limit. Good luck!
